# MTEBWY: Cloud Resource Usage Forecasting with Representation Learning

## Introduction

This repository will soon contain the source code for the MTEBWY system described in the paper "Toward Using Representation Learning for Cloud Resource Usage Forecasting". MTEBWY is a system prototype that leverages representation learning to forecast cloud resource usage with high accuracy.

The key highlights of the MTEBWY system are:

1. **Representation Learning**: MTEBWY transforms cloud resource usage time series into high-dimensional embeddings using the word2vec technique. This allows it to better capture the relative context of the usage patterns.

2. **Prediction Mechanism**: MTEBWY explores the spatial proximity of the generated embeddings to produce a set of top-K predictions for the next time step's resource usage.

3. **High Accuracy**: The experimental analysis in the paper shows that MTEBWY significantly outperforms current machine learning-based forecasting models in terms of prediction error (Mean Absolute Error).

4. **Low Overhead**: In contrast to complex neural network models, the learning and prediction overheads of MTEBWY are negligible.

## Upcoming Features

The current paper presents a proof-of-concept for the MTEBWY system. Future work will focus on the following enhancements:

1. **Complete System**: The authors will develop a mechanism to select a single accurate prediction from the set of top-K predictions generated by MTEBWY.

2. **Generalization and Continuous Learning**: The authors aim to investigate techniques to generalize the representation learning across multiple time series and enable the system to continuously adapt to dynamic or unseen resource usage patterns.

3. **Extended Evaluation**: The authors will evaluate MTEBWY on a wider range of cloud datasets, including resource usage at the physical machine, virtual machine, and serverless function levels.

## Source Code Release

The source code for the MTEBWY system will be published and made available in this repository soon. Stay tuned for the update!
